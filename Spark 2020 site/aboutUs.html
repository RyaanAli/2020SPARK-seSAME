            <h1>Ryaan Irshad Ali</h1>
            <p>I’m a passionate highschool student attending Central Peel Secondary School who always loves a chance to learn more. Whether it be coding or cooking I always keep an open mind to learning new things. The entire site here was made from scratch using HTML and CSS which I picked up a day before and during the hackathon. Please excuse any messiness in the code since I’m extremely new to HTML and CSS, but feel free to take a look and point out better ways to code it. I was very excited to see the opportunity to address the ongoing issue of mental health during the hackathon and it provided another chance to put my knowledge to good use. I am proud to be a co-founder of Real-Lax and hope you see the potential in this app as well. If you have any questions about Real-Lax, are interested in learning more about Real-Lax, or have any suggestions for the website code or Real-Lax, email me at ryaanali123@gmail.com.(Thanks gaurav for the Spark 2019 photo of me)</p>

            <h1>Ruhaim Irshad Ali</h1>
            <p>Salutations my name is Ruhaim and I am currently attending Central Peel Secondary School. I am one of the co-founders of Real-Lax. As a busy student, I used to have difficulty getting time to care for my mental health and did not believe mental health was important. But after feeling the pain associated with poor mental health I decided to find the best ways to be mentally healthy. After spending countless hours I now understand the importance of mental health and how to improve my own mental health. The theme of this hackathon was wondrous and I was able to further my understanding on the topic of mind through a variety of ways, for example researching and playing an important role in the creation of our prototype app. The goal I had while creating Real-Lax was to provide others with knowledge to improve their mental health as I understand the struggles they may go through. Through Real-Lax I know how to assist and aid people, further my knowledge and improve my transferable skills, especially technological fluency. Overall, this has been an amazing experience and I am proud of Real-Lax!</p>
